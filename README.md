SQL BASED- E-COMMERCE SALES ANALYTICS WAREHOUSE
📌Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline and analytics workflow using PostgreSQL.
It follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to transform raw data into clean, analytics-ready data, and finally into insights for dashboards.
The goal is to showcase data cleaning, modeling, and business intelligence skills with SQL.

⚡ Tech Stack
•	Database: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin for queries)
•	Architecture: Medallion (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
•	Languages: SQL
•	Visualization: Power BI
________________________________________
🏗️ Architecture
1.	Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
o	Stores raw unprocessed data (customers, products, orders, order_items, shipments).
o	Minimal cleaning (loading as-is).
2.	Silver Layer (Cleaned & Standardized Data)
o	Standardizes formats (dates, text casing, null handling).
o	Validates fields (e.g., numeric prices, positive quantities).
o	Removes invalid or missing records.
3.	Gold Layer (Analytics & Facts/Dimensions)
o	Star schema with fact tables (orders, order_items, shipments) and dimension tables (customers, products, date).
o	Designed for business intelligence and reporting.

📂 Data Model
🟦 Dimension Tables
•	dim_customers → Customer info (name, country, signup date)
•	dim_products → Product catalog (product, category, price)
•	dim_date → Calendar table (date, year, month, day)
🟨 Fact Tables
•	fact_orders → Orders with total amounts
•	fact_order_items → Order details with product quantities & revenue
•	fact_shipments → Delivery times & shipment status
________________________________________
📊 Analytics Queries
1. Sales Trends
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)::DATE AS month,
       SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales
FROM gold.fact_orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
➡️ Insight: Monthly sales performance over time
________________________________________
2. Top Products by Revenue
SELECT p.product_name, 
       SUM(oi.total_price) AS revenue
FROM gold.fact_order_items oi
JOIN gold.dim_products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
➡️ Insight: Best-performing products
________________________________________
3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
SELECT c.name, 
       SUM(o.total_amount) AS lifetime_value
FROM gold.fact_orders o
JOIN gold.dim_customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;
➡️ Insight: Top customers by total spend
________________________________________
4. Delivery Performance
SELECT AVG(delivery_days) AS avg_delivery_time,
       SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_days > 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100 AS pct_delayed
FROM gold.fact_shipments;
➡️ Insight: Average delivery speed & % delayed shipments
________________________________________
5. Repeat Customers %
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FILTER (WHERE total_orders > 1)::FLOAT / 
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS repeat_customer_pct
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
    FROM gold.fact_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS customer_orders;
➡️ Insight: Share of repeat customers
________________________________________
📈 Dashboard Ideas
•	Sales Overview → Monthly revenue trend
•	Top Customers → CLV leaderboard
•	Top Products → Revenue by product
•	Client Retention → Avg % of client who have repeat purchase 
•	Delivery Insights → Avg delivery time, % delayed shipments
